# UNCOVERING ChatGPT's POPULARITY USING SENTIMENTAL DATA ANALYSIS

This project undertook a **sentiment data analysis of ChatGPT-related tweets** during its initial release phase, utilizing a dataset comprising approximately 5 lakh tweets sourced from Kaggle. The analysis focused on categorizing user reactions into **positive, negative, and neutral sentiments** and exploring sentiment trends from January 2023 to April 2023. Additionally, the project compared sentiment analysis results obtained from the **Vader** and **TextBlob** libraries and visualized the findings using Matplotlib. Through this comprehensive analysis, insights were gleaned into the public perception and sentiment towards ChatGPT during its early stages of release.

Furthermore, the sentiment trends over time revealed dynamic shifts in public perception towards ChatGPT throughout the initial release phase. This temporal analysis uncovered spikes in positive sentiment coinciding with significant milestones or announcements related to ChatGPT's development or applications. Conversely, periods of heightened negative sentiment often correlated with controversies, technical issues, or discussions surrounding the ethical implications of AI technologies.
The comparison between sentiment analysis results from Vader and TextBlob offered valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of each sentiment analysis tool. While both libraries provided useful frameworks for analyzing sentiment, variations in classification accuracy and sensitivity to context were observed. These findings underscored the importance of carefully selecting and validating sentiment analysis tools based on the specific requirements of the analysis.

The visualization of sentiment analysis findings using Matplotlib not only facilitated a clearer understanding of sentiment trends but also enabled stakeholders to identify actionable insights and make data-driven decisions. Through visually compelling charts and graphs, patterns and outliers in sentiment data were highlighted, providing a roadmap for addressing concerns, capitalizing on positive feedback, and shaping future strategies related to ChatGPT.
